                            <p>APON appreciates and understands the necessity of a basic health and hygiene education
                                for the children. Many APON students spend the entire day in garbage dumps sifting
                                through filth to collect paper/plastic bags to benefit from their resale value in the
                                market. These children are highly susceptible to various respiratory and skin diseases.
                                While considerations of health and hygiene demand a complete abstention from such
                                activities, the harsh realities of life dictate otherwise. Most children are significant
                                income earners for their family. Not going to work for even a day means not enough food
                                for the family. APON seeks to minimize the inevitable risk that these children are
                                exposed to by teaching them how to clean themselves after handling rubbish and also
                                explaining the toxic effect of materials they handle every day. APON appreciates and understands the necessity of a basic health and hygiene education
